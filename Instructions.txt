Graduate Admission Prediction

This project predicts the admission of a student based on different features including university rating, student’s undergrade GPA,
GRE score, research experience and etc. This predicts that how much chances are there that the student will get admission in his
selected university or not.

In this project I have used multiple regression algorithms including linear regression, random forest regressor, decision tree regressor. In the end I 
deployed Linear Regression model beacuse of better accuracy than other models.
